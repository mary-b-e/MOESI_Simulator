# MOESI_Simulator
This is a simulator of a cache using the MOESI coherency protocol written in C for multicached systems and uses a cli for navigation
# NOTE: There has been some issues with connecting my local vscode to the remote github account, and to do this properly I will need to make a new key to use. 
I will be doing this later to put the full repo here
